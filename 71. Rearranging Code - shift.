The -> macro threads an expression x through a variable number of forms. First, x is inserted as the second item in the first form, making a list of it if it is not a list already. Then the first form is inserted as the second item in the second form, making a list of that form if necessary. This process continues for all the forms. Using -> can sometimes make your code more readable.
