The contains? function checks if a KEY is present in a given collection. This often leads beginner clojurians to use it incorrectly with numerically indexed collections like vectors and lists.

1. (contains? #{4 5 6} __)
2. (contains? [1 1 1 1 1] __)
3. (contains? {4 :a 2 :b} __)
4. (not (contains? '(1 2 4) __))
