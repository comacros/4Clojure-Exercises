Pascal's triangle is a triangle of numbers computed using the following rules:

- The first row is 1.
- Each successive row is computed by adding together adjacent numbers in the row above, and adding a 1 to the beginning and end of the row.

Write a function which returns the nth row of Pascal's Triangle.

1. (= (__ 1) [1])
2. (= (map __ (range 1 6))
      [     [1]
           [1 1]
          [1 2 1]
         [1 3 3 1]
        [1 4 6 4 1]])
2. (= (__ 11)
      [1 10 45 120 210 252 210 120 45 10 1])

Solutions:

1. (fn foo [n]
     (if (= 1 n)
       [1]
       (#(concat '(1)
                 (map + % (concat (rest %) '(0))))
        (foo (dec n)))))
