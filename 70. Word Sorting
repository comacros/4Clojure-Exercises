Difficulty:	Medium
Topics:	sorting

Write a function that splits a sentence up into a sorted list of words. Capitalization should not affect sort order and punctuation should be ignored.

1. (= (__  "Have a nice day.")
      ["a" "day" "Have" "nice"])
2. (= (__  "Clojure is a fun language!")
      ["a" "Clojure" "fun" "is" "language"])
3. (= (__  "Fools fall for foolish follies.")
      ["fall" "follies" "foolish" "Fools" "for"])

Solutions:

1. #(sort (fn [x y] (compare (.toUpperCase x) (.toUpperCase y)))
          (re-seq #"\w+" %))
