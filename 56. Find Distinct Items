Write a function which removes the duplicates from a sequence. Order of the items must be maintained.

Special Restrictions: distinct

1. (= (__ [1 2 1 3 1 2 4]) [1 2 3 4])
2. (= (__ [:a :a :b :b :c :c]) [:a :b :c])
3. (= (__ '([2 4] [1 2] [1 3] [1 3])) '([2 4] [1 2] [1 3]))
4. (= (__ (range 50)) (range 50))

Solutions:

1. (fn [xs]
     (loop [y [] z xs]
       (if (= 0 (count z))
         y
         (if-not (let [z2 z] (some (fn [t] (= t (first z2))) y))
           (recur (conj y (first z)) (rest z))
           (recur y (rest z))))))
