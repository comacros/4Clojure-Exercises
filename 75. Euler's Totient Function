Two numbers are coprime if their greatest common divisor equals 1. Euler's totient function f(x) is defined as the number of positive integers less than x which are coprime to x. The special case f(1) equals 1. Write a function which calculates Euler's totient function.

1. (= (__ 1) 1)
2. (= (__ 10) (count '(1 3 7 9)) 4)
3. (= (__ 40) 16)
4. (= (__ 99) 60)

Solutions:

1. (fn totient [n]
     (let [gcd (fn [x y]
                 (loop [a x b y]
                   (if (= 0 (rem a b))
                     b
                     (recur b (rem a b)))))
           coprime? (fn [x y]
                      (= 1 (gcd x y)))]
       (count (for [i (range 1 (inc n))
                    :when (coprime? n i)] i))))
