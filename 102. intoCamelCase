Difficulty:	Medium
Topics:	strings

When working with java, you often need to create an object with fieldsLikeThis, but you'd rather work with a hashmap that has :keys-like-this until it's time to convert. Write a function which takes lower-case hyphen-separated strings and converts them to camel-case strings.

1. (= (__ "something") "something")
2. (= (__ "multi-word-key") "multiWordKey")
3. (= (__ "leaveMeAlone") "leaveMeAlone")

Solutions:

1. (fn foo [x]
     (let [xs (re-seq #"[^-]+" x)
           ys (for [_ (rest xs)]
                (apply str
                       (concat (.toUpperCase (str (first _)))
                               (rest _))))]
       (apply str (conj ys (first xs)))))
