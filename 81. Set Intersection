Write a function which returns the intersection of two sets. The intersection is the sub-set of items that each set has in common.

Special Restrictions: intersection

1. (= (__ #{0 1 2 3} #{2 3 4 5}) #{2 3})
2. (= (__ #{0 1 2} #{3 4 5}) #{})
3. (= (__ #{:a :b :c :d} #{:c :e :a :f :d}) #{:a :c :d})

Solutions:

1. (fn foo [xset yset]
     (let [xlist (apply conj '() xset)
           ylist (apply conj '() yset)
           xylist (concat xlist ylist)
           xyfreq (frequencies xylist)]
       (set (for [kv xyfreq :when (> (second kv) 1)] (first kv)))))
