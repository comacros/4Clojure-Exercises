Transform a sequence into a sequence of pairs containing the original elements along with their index.

1. (= (__ [:a :b :c]) [[:a 0] [:b 1] [:c 2]])
2. (= (__ [0 1 3]) '((0 0) (1 1) (3 2)))
3. (= (__ [[:foo] {:bar :baz}]) [[[:foo] 0] [{:bar :baz} 1]])

Solutions:

1. (fn foo [xs]
     (let [ys (range 0 (count xs))
           zs (partition 2 (interleave xs ys))]
       (for [z zs] (vec z))))
