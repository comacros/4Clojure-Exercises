A number is "perfect" if the sum of its divisors equal the number itself. 6 is a perfect number because 1+2+3=6. Write a function which returns true for perfect numbers and false otherwise.

1. (= (__ 6) true)
2. (= (__ 7) false)
3. (= (__ 496) true)
4. (= (__ 500) false)
5. (= (__ 8128) true)

Solutions:

1. (fn foo [n]
     (let [n2 (int (Math/sqrt n))
           divisors (for [x (range 1 (inc n2))
                          :when (= 0 (rem n x))] [x (/ n x)])]
       (= (apply + (flatten divisors)) (* 2 n))))
