Write a function which returns a sequence of lists of x items each. Lists of less than x items should not be returned.

Special Restrictions: partition partition-all

1. (= (__ 3 (range 9)) '((0 1 2) (3 4 5) (6 7 8)))
2. (= (__ 2 (range 8)) '((0 1) (2 3) (4 5) (6 7)))
3. (= (__ 3 (range 8)) '((0 1 2) (3 4 5)))

Solutions:

1. (fn foo [n xs]
     (if-not (> n (count xs))
       (concat [(take n xs)] (foo n (drop n xs)))))
