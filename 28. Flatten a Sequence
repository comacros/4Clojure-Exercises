Write a function which flattens a sequence.

Special Restrictions: flatten

1. (= (__ '((1 2) 3 [4 [5 6]])) '(1 2 3 4 5 6))
2. (= (__ ["a" ["b"] "c"]) '("a" "b" "c"))
3. (= (__ '((((:a))))) '(:a))

Solutions:

1. (fn foo [xs]
     (if (sequential? xs)
       (if (= 0 (count xs))
         nil
         (concat (list)
                 (foo (first xs))
                 (foo (rest xs))))
       (list xs)))
