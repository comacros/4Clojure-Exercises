Write a function which separates the items of a sequence by an arbitrary value.

Special Restrictions: interpose

1. (= (__ 0 [1 2 3]) [1 0 2 0 3])
2. (= (apply str (__ ", " ["one" "two" "three"])) "one, two, three")
3. (= (__ :z [:a :b :c :d]) [:a :z :b :z :c :z :d])

Solutions:

1. (fn foo [x ys]
     (let [xy (for [y ys] (list x y))]
       (drop 1 (reduce concat [] xy))))
