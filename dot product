Difficulty: Easy
Topics:     seqs math

Create a function that computes the dot product of two sequences. You may assume that the vectors will have the same length.

1. (= 0 (__ [0 1 1] [1 0 0]))
2. (= 3 (__ [1 1 1] [1 1 1]))
3. (= 32 (__ [1 2 3] [4 5 6]))
4. (= 256 (__ [2 5 6] [100 10 1]))

Solutions:

1. #(apply + (map * %1 %2))

  Similarly:
    #(reduce + (map * %1 %2))
