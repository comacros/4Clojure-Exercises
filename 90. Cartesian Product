Write a function which calculates the Cartesian product of two sets.

1. (= (__ #{"ace" "king" "queen"} #{"♠" "♥" "♦" "♣"})
      #{["ace"   "♠"] ["ace"   "♥"] ["ace"   "♦"] ["ace"   "♣"]
        ["king"  "♠"] ["king"  "♥"] ["king"  "♦"] ["king"  "♣"]
        ["queen" "♠"] ["queen" "♥"] ["queen" "♦"] ["queen" "♣"]})
2. (= (__ #{1 2 3} #{4 5})
      #{[1 4] [2 4] [3 4] [1 5] [2 5] [3 5]})
3. (= 300 (count (__ (into #{} (range 10))
                     (into #{} (range 30)))))

Solutions:

1. (fn [xs ys]
     (apply conj #{} (for [x xs y ys] [x y])))
